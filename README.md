# Paintball-Legacy-Wiki

Paintball War Edition is a Bukkit plugin which adds fun snowball fights to Minecraft. 'Paintball Legacy' denotes the versions v1.+ of that project. Later versions (v2.+) are in the works, but not available yet.

You can **download** the plugin at its [**project page**](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/paintball_pure_war).

You can find **documentation** on how to setup and use Paintball in the [**wiki**](https://github.com/PaintballWarEdition/Paintball-Legacy-Wiki/wiki).<br>
The wiki is a work-in-progress. In the meantime lots of documentation is still available on the project page as well.

For **issues**, **suggestions** or **questions** simply [**create an issue**](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/paintball_pure_war/issues).
